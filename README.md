# covid_exposure

Comparing numbers of keys downloaded daily by Scotland's COVID Exposure Notification [app](https://protect.scot) to the number of new daily cases.

The number of keys downloaded should be the number of positive cases who have chosen to log their positive test via the app. 

Note there will likely be different time lags involved between the two quantities, and lack of completeness in most recent plotted time periods.
